# LogisticRegression

## Overview

This project implements a classification problem where songs are categorized into pop and classical music. A logistic regression method is used and the results are analyzed with two evaluation metrics.

## Objective

The goal of this project is to develop a model that can classify songs into either the pop or classical category.

## Data Preparation

A important part of the training process is the dataset. It must be in a suitable format. Therefore, the dataset is first analyzed and prepared for the machine learning process. 

## Implementation

1. **Data Preparation**:
   - Analyze the dataset
   - Reduce the data
   - Split the data into training and testing sets

2. **Modeling**:
   - Implement logistic regression machine learning model
   - Train the model with the data
   - Review the trained model with the cross entropy loss

3. **Evaluation**:
   - Evaluate the performance using two evaluation metrics
   - Metrics: - Accuracy
              - Confusion Matrix
